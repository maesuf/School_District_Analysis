# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis was to revalue the data set after after a particular group of scores were omitted due to academic dishonesty. 

## Analysis
### There was no significant change in the district summary since the overall passing only increased from 90% to 91%
### The school summary was not affected. The overall % passing for Thomas high school after the ninth grade results were replaced remained the same and the averages for the other high schools remained the same as well. 
###  Thomas High School had a significant increase in both reading and math after the 9th grade data were replaced. This caused the overall % passing to increase to %90 for Thomas High School
###  There was no change in the math and reading scores by grade since only the 9th grade socres were replaced for Thomas High School. Therefore, the only noticeable change was the NaN value for that cell
### There was no stastically significant change observed in the scores by school spending, scores by school size or the scores by school type. 

## Results
### The overall summary of the results remained the same after the 9th grade scores were replaced. This is becuase only 461 9th grade scores were replaced which only accounted for 1% of the orginial total student count. This meant that there was only a 1% change or delta in the total count after the scores were replaced.
